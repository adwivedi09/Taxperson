Calculate the total cost of an item including tax based on whether it is considered a necessary or luxury item. 
The tax rate for basic necessities is 1%, the tax rate for luxury items is 9%. For simplicity of implementation, 
all transactions are measured in cents (pennies).

item including the tax.
